Methode Graphs are developed using open source draw.io for example as WebApp at https://app.diagrams.net/
Ontology entities are represented by shapes avaiable after opening the library at https://chowlk.linkeddata.es/resources/chowlk-drawio-library.xml

Finished graphes are converted in UI at https://chowlk.linkeddata.es/
