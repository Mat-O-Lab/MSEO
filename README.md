# MSEO
Repository of Materials Science and Engineering Ontology - MSEO.
Home of the mid and domain level modules of the Materials Sience and Engineering Ontology MSEO as well as Tools too transform experiment data.

MSEO utilizes the Common Core Ontology stack giving materials scientists and engineers the ability to represent their experiments and resulting data. The goal is to create machine and human readable sematic data which can be easily digested by other science domains.  It is a product of the joint venture [Materials Open Lab Project](https://matolab.materials.digital/) between the [Bundesanstalt für Materialforschung und -prüfung (BAM)](https://www.bam.de) and the [Fraunhofer Group MATERIALS](https://www.materials.fraunhofer.de) and uses the [BWMD ontology](https://matportal.org/ontologies/BWMD-MID) created by [Fraunhofer IWM](https://www.iwm.fraunhofer.de) as a starting point.
